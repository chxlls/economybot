# Economy Bot
### Using Quick.db & Discord.js (V11)

## THIS WAS ORIGINALLY CODED FOR DJS V11 SO IT WILL NOT PROPERLY WORK ON V12 UNLESS YOU UPDATE IT

##### This was a quick personal project (Following a Youtube tutorial) but never ended up fully finishing (cleaning up code, proper checks etc) and felt like this may help people.
##### A star is always appreciated. I am not updating this anymore.

# Introduction
Welcome to the Economy Bot project! This project is an open-source Discord bot that was created to provide a fun and interactive economy system for Discord servers. Some functionality includes checking a user's balance, begging for money, buying items, earning daily bonuses, depositing and withdrawing funds, accessing the leaderboard, paying other users, viewing profile information, removing money, robbing other users, playing roulette, selling items, playing slots, accessing a virtual store, earning weekly bonuses, and working for money. These features provide users with a fun and engaging way to interact with each other within the context of a virtual economy, adding an extra layer of excitement and competition to your Discord experience.
